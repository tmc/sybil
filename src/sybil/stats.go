// Using an analysis of variance, calculate the intra class correlation co-efficient
// The ICC is defined as: (mean square between) / (mean square between + mean square within)
// or: (mean square between - mean square within) / (mean square between + mean square within)
// For this function, I'm using the first definition because it stops at 0 (and we don't have
// to interpret negative correlations)

// to calculate MSB and MSW, we use sum of squares between and sum of squares within
// MSB = SSB / (K - 1)
// MSW = SSW / (N - len(groups))
// K = len(groups)
// N = total sample count

// to calculate SSW and SSB, we do:
// SSW = sum of squares within groups. Take each group and calculate its
// variance, then add all those variances together
// SSB = sum of square between groups. Take each group's averages and calculate their
// variance against the overall average.
